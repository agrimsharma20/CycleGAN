# CycleGAN
In this project, we attempt to modify the Loss function, and the architecture and analyze the results.
The code used for the project is added here.

Notes:
For Modified Loss Functions, review the backward_G function in line 153 of models/cycle_gan_model.py and read the comments to enable to correct loss function.
For Embedded CycleGAN, review the forward function in line 375 of models/networks.py and read comments to enable the appropriate model for training and testing.
